 * A non-secure client's wolfHSM wire packet arrives as invec[0] of one
 * psa_call, is handed opaquely to the platform's submit hook (on target, the
 * monitor's per-guest server tasklet), and the server's response packet is
 * written back as outvec[0]. The relay never parses packet contents — the
 * wolfHSM comm layer owns the protocol; the SPM owns caller identity and the
 * copied-transfer bounds (WT-FFM-0041/0047). A Secure Partition caller's
 * PSA_IPC_CALL is refused with PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED. */
